# Rotary phone to MQTT

In this project I made the old rotary phone to smart. It sends the rotated numbers to an MQTT server. Later this information can be used to autamate everything.

The project based on this library
https://github.com/markfickett/Rotary-Dial

It counts the pulses of the phone then retuns with the result.
